Description
Push_swap is a highly efficient algorithmic project at 42 School. The goal is simple: sort data on a stack, with a limited set of instructions, using the lowest possible number of actions.

The project involves two stacks, A and B, and requires a deep understanding of complexity and algorithm optimization to achieve the best score.

Instructions
The project includes a Makefile that follows 42 standards. To compile the program, run: make
This will produce the push_swap executable.
Run the program by passing a list of integers as arguments:
./push_swap 3 2 10 45 1
The program will output the list of instructions (e.g., pb, ra, rr, pa) required to sort the stack.

Resources
The "Turkish Algorithm" Concept: Originally popularized by A. Yigit Ogun, this method is highly effective for the 100 and 500 number benchmarks.
